# Youtube-Trend-Analysis-with-ArangoDB-Graph-Database
## Problem Statement
Youtube is the most widely used and popular streaming platform in the world today. For a video to 
reach to maximum people, YouTube offers a trending page on website that shows videos which are 
trending at that particular time. Other than few viral videos that achieve high traction which are 
predictable to end up in trending section, rest of the videos cannot be predicted. In some cases, the 
videos achieve traction at a later stage and this analysis is usually difficult to track. Hence , a multimodel 
database that deals with analysis of YouTube Data on Trending Videos is introduced in this project.
